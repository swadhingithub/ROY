# Road map for Researching API Security 
___


___
### **1. Understanding the Basics**

#### **1.1 API Security**

- Learn about common API security vulnerabilities:
    - **OWASP API Security Top 10**
    - **Common attack vectors** (e.g., Injection attacks, Broken Authentication, Rate Limiting Bypasses)
    - **Current API security best practices** (OAuth, JWT, API Gateway, etc.)

#### **1.2 Machine Learning in Cybersecurity**

- Learn **Supervised vs. Unsupervised ML** techniques.
- Study **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Anomaly Detection**.
- Explore real-world use cases of **ML in security**.

### **2. Literature Review**

- **Find existing research papers** on:
    
    - API security threats and countermeasures.
    - Machine Learning techniques for detecting API anomalies.
- Recommended platforms for papers:
    
    - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
    - [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)
    - [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/)
    - [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/)
    - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (for open-access papers)
- Identify **gaps in existing research** where ML can improve API security.

    - **Custom API logs** (Capture real-world API traffic and label anomalies)

#### **3.2 Selecting a Machine Learning Model**

- **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, DBSCAN
- **Classification**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Deep Learning (LSTMs, CNNs)
- **Feature Engineering**: Analyze API request/response patterns, authentication mechanisms, and metadata.

#### **3.3 Model Training & Evaluation**

- Use Python frameworks like **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch**.
- Evaluate model performance using **Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC**.

---

### **4. Experimentation & Analysis**
